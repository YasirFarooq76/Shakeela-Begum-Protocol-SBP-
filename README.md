# Shakeela-Begum-Protocol-SBP-
The Shakeela Begum Protocol™ (SBP) is a three‑step reflective prompting framework designed to improve clarity, reduce ambiguity, and produce deeper, insight‑focused responses from humans and AI systems. SBP restructures any question or instruction into a clearer cognitive sequence that naturally forces better reasoning.
